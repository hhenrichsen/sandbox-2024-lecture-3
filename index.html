              It's easy to get carried away when you're building a new web app.
              You've got big ideas, you picture millions of users flocking to
              your platform, and you start imagining the kind of infrastructure
              needed to handle all that traffic. So, you build for scale from
              day oneâ€”optimising databases, setting up powerful servers, and
              ensuring everything is robust enough for massive growth.
              <br /><br />
              But hold on a second. If you don't even have 100 users yet,
              designing your app for millions is a massive overreach. In fact,
              it's probably holding you back more than helping.
